Week 1
I didn't really use AI that much this week, one instance of me using chatgpt was to try and route audio from my DAW instead of using a virtual mixing software.

Week 2 
I used AI to help make a comparison chart between two philosophers for class review

Week 3
I used AI to help me review and clarify concepts for philosophy once again

Week4
I used AI to help me review for my philosophy midterm

Week5
I used AI to help me brainstorm functions for our project
https://chatgpt.com/share/68e98167-6c10-8003-9c16-54e0cda53562

***Which functions received AI assistance
•	validate_case_entry()
•	format_date()
•	clean_case_data()

I discussed overall structure and strategies for validation, data cleaning, and date normalization with ChatGPT. 
The functions generate_epidemic_summary() and other logic were implemented independently without AI guidance.

***What prompts you used and why
I used AI mainly to brainstorm approaches and clarify best practices for structuring small utility functions.
•	Prompt 1:
“I’m building a function that validates case data for a public health dataset. It’s a list of dictionaries with date, location, and case count. How can I approach this in Python without using libraries like pandas?”
I asked this because I wanted a simple, library-free way to validate nested dictionaries. AI helped outline a clean structure for looping through records and checking key validity.
•	Prompt 2:
“Some of the case dates in my data look like ‘03/01/25’ or ‘2025-03-01.’ I just need them to be consistent. What’s a simple way to standardize them without external libraries?”
I used this to learn about Python’s built-in methods for parsing and reformatting dates. AI introduced the idea of using .zfill() for zero-padding and replacing slashes with dashes, which I later customized.
These conversations were mainly for conceptual and formatting guidance — all final code was rewritten and adapted for my project’s domain.
***How you validated and modified AI suggestions
After receiving the AI examples, I made several changes before integrating anything:
•	Simplified structure: I rewrote the validate_case_entry() function to focus only on existence and emptiness checks, rather than relying on external validation modules or exceptions.
I tested each function with sample datasets containing bad entries (missing keys, invalid dates, non-integer cases) and verified that the cleaning process worked correctly end to end.
***What you learned from the AI collaboration process
•	I realized that AI can provide a helpful scaffold, but manual review is essential to catch subtle domain errors and ensure readability.
•	I gained experience in verifying AI-generated logic by writing test examples and comparing outputs to expected results.
•	It reinforced that I should treat AI output as a draft, not a finished product.
***Decisions you made to improve AI-generated code
•	Added stricter validation: Introduced input type checks and explicit "INVALID" outputs instead of silent failures.
•	Improved readability: Wrote detailed docstrings with examples and parameter explanations.
•	Extended scope: Expanded the cleaning process to handle capitalization (.title() for locations) and numeric conversion for case counts.

Week6
I used AI to help me review for my Myth midterm

Week7
I used AI to help me plan and review the object-oriented design for my part of the project.

Which classes received AI assistance

• CaseRecord
• CaseDataset

I discussed how to convert procedural code from Project 1 into a class-based design and how to add validation and encapsulation properly.
The rest of the logic—cleaning, filtering, and summarizing was written and tested independently after reviewing AI examples.

Prompts I used

• Prompt 1:
“I’m trying to convert my Project 1 public-health data functions into a class. How should I start defining a simple CaseRecord class with attributes like date, location, age, and cases, including validation inside __init__?”
I used this to understand how to structure the class so that validation happened automatically when creating new records.
AI helped outline a clean constructor format and the idea of using helper methods to organize validation.
• Prompt 2:
“If I want each case record to validate its fields automatically, should I use helper methods or property setters? I’m not sure how to keep the constructor clean but still check the inputs.”
This helped me compare different approaches for encapsulation and decide to keep internal helper methods (like _validate_age and _format_date) for clarity.
• Prompt 3:
“How can I make sure my dataset methods use clear names that match my Project 1 functions? I want it to feel consistent but organized for OOP.”
I used this to plan method naming in a way that stayed familiar from Project 1 while still fitting OOP style conventions.
